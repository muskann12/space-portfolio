        My journey started with a fascination for how the backend of websites functioned, but quickly evolved into a love for web development and design. After diving into IT Automation and earning my certification in Python, I expanded my skills into UI/UX design, which allowed me to blend technical knowledge with a keen sense of aesthetics. I thrive on learning new things, pushing the boundaries of design and technology, and continuing to evolve as a front-end developer.
